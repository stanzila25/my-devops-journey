# My DevOps Journey

welcome to my first DevOps project!

This repository is a structured showcase of my learning in:
- âœ… Linux Basics (linux-basics/)
- âœ… Networking Fundamentals (networking-fundamentals/)
- âœ… DevOps Tools Overview (devops-tools-overview/)

- I'm currently learning DevOps step by step and updating this repo as I go.
Stay tuned for shell scripts, Docker examples, and CI/CD workflows! ðŸŒ±
